# BlackstoneHR Custom UI

This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript application for the BlackstoneHR custom interface.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server on the forwarded container port:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The command binds Vite to `0.0.0.0` on port `4173` with logs left on screen so the environment's port-forwarding preview can reach it.

3. Open the forwarded port (4173) from your environment to preview the application.

## Additional scripts

- `npm run build` – type-checks and builds the production bundle.
- `npm run lint` – runs ESLint over the project.
- `npm run preview` – serves the built production bundle locally.
